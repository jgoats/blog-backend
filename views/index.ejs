            <div class="introduction">
                Learning JavaScript is hard. Sure, the basics are very easy to understand if you are persistent
                or if you have learned other programming languages. But once you get past the basics the language
                quickly becomes
                very confusing to a lot of people. JavaScript does a lot of things in the background that can trip up
                even senior developers.
                During equality checks, JavaScript will attempt to change the data type of one operand to match the
                second if they are different,
                Classes in JavaScript aren't really classes at all, they are actually constructor functions behind
                the
                scenes.
                Almost everything in JavaScript is classified as an object, this includes functions , arrays , and
                heck
                the type of "null" is even equal to
                "Object" under the hood despite being a primitive type. Confused yet? I was for a long time while
                learning JavaScript. There are a
                lot
                of resources out there to learn JavaScript
                but I quickly found that most of that information was not explaining how JavaScript really behaves
                under
                the hood. It's hard to truely master somthing
                when you dont even know how it works behind the scenes. Well i'm here to attempt to break down
                JavaScript
                at a deep level so that we all walk away as better JavaScript
                developers.
